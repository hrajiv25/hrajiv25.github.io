    <p style="text-decoration-color: blueviolet"> <h1>Introduction</h1> Imagine you're at the beach on a hot summer day and you decide to go in the ocean with a parent. Say the 
        water level is too high for you to walk so you have to swim,otherwise you would have to stay where you 
        are, or else you would drown. It is also one of the sports in the summer olympics. There 4 basic strokes 
        inside of the  sport of swimming. Look at all images to help you understand.</p>
        <img src= "images/beach.gif">
        <p> <h1> Freestyle</h1> Freestyle is one of the 4 main strokes in competitions.The legs perform a flutter kick during the entire duration of
            the  laps. The flutter kick will be explained later in the article. the arms perform circles and graceful motion. The motion is similar to a windmill.
            Freestyle is the easiest storke to learn.  This makes it usually the first stroke learned and the first performed in competitions.
        <p> <h1> Backstroke</h1> Backstroke is a resting stroke, done if you are feeling tired. This is like freestyle, but done on the back.
                        backstroke is usually learned second. This because it is the second easiest.this is considered a resting stroke because </p>
                        it is done on the back, allowing for easy breating. It is also one of the most hard strokes to compete in. this also uses
                        the flutter kick. The flutter kick is done from the knees down.</p>
        <p> <h1> Breast Stroke</h1> Breast stroke is another resting stroke. It has it's own kicThik. During Breast stroke the arms create a pie then cut
            a slice out of the pie. the legs bend up at the kness the go down and out in a circular motion. The legs are always conected at the knees.
            This is a stroke usually done slowly, but in competitions, is done as fast as possible obvisiously. When you get to the end of a lap you
            do a round off instead of a flipturn. A roundoff is when one arm hits  wall your knees and head face one directcion along with your other 
            arm. With your feet on the wall, you push of then once you come back to the surface, you resume Breast stroke or Butterfly.</p>

        <p> <h1> Butterfly</h1> Butterfly is the final stroke. This stroke requires a lot of upper body strength.The arms pull back and around in 
               circles. The legs do flutter kicks. Flutter kicks are done from the hips then the knees and lastly the feet. Imagine a wave in 
               ocean. This is how the legs move. When you hit the end of a pool, then you do a roundoff, just like in Breaststroke. While underwater 
               after the roundoff you do flutter kicks until you come to the surface. In competitions you never breate as soon as you come up. </p>

        <p> <h1> Conclusion</h1> Swimming is a vast sport and is also an essential skill. Swimming can also allow you to see beautiful things in 
                nature yourself and not in photos. You could go scuba diving and see coral reefs and observe schools of fish. If that doesn't excite
                you, then maybe swimming with dolphins will. Instead of sitting on the beach and making sand castles  or reading instead of being out
                in the water with everyone else, you could jumping waves with them. These are things that knowing how to siwm can let you do.</p>
